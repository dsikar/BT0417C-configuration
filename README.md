BT0417C Configuration
==============

# What is the BT0417C?

The BT0417C is a Wireless Bluetooth TTL Transceiver Module on one end and RS232 communication at the other. That means you can use it to add Bluetooth to any RS232 enabled device such as a microcontroller.  
At the heart of this breakout board, manufactured by mdfly.com is the CSR BC417 chip, once manufactured by CSR (Cambridge Silicon Radio Limited now Qualcomm).

# Configuration

To configure the module, wire the breakout board to an Anduino Uno, load the sketch and change the parameters to suit your application.

## Wiring

Wire ground (green) and +5V (red) from your breadboard to the UNO (the actual labels will be written at the back of the BT0417C). Once the module is powered up, a blinking LED indicates that Bluetooth radio is functional but device is not paired. Once it is paired, the LED will stay on and stop blinking.
